# Player Project.

## 1 Overview

The **CA_OOP_Player** project is a Python based application that implements a `Player` class to manage player details such as first name, last name, speed, and nickname. The project also includes unit tests to ensure robust and reliable functionality. Additionally, this project demonstrates the use of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline implemented with Azure DevOps to automate the build and test process.

At the center of the project is the Player class, which allows you to create players with details like their first name (fname), last name `lname`, `speed`, `nickname`, and a unique `ID`. For `example`, a player might have the name "Pedro Perez," a speed of 10, and a unique ID of 1. The ID is automatically assigned when the player is created, ensuring every player has a unique identifier.

The `Player` class also keeps a list of all players created, making it possible to perform group operations. For instance, you can calculate the `average speed` of `all players` or find the maximum speed among them. This makes the class both useful for managing individual players and for analyzing data about `multiple players`.

**Example Code:** Creating Players and Checking Their Details.
Here, we create two players. player1 is named "Pedro Perez" with a speed of 10, and player2 is named "Juan Smith" with a speed of 15.


```python
from DM_Player.Player import Player
# Create players
player1 = Player("Pedro", "Perez", 10)
player2 = Player("Juan", "Smith", 15)

# Check details
print(player1.fname)  # Output: Pedro
print(player1.id)     # Output: 1
print(player2.id)     # Output: 2
```

- **What Does the Player Class Do?**

The Player class makes sure that the information provided when creating a player is valid. For example, the speed must be a number greater than zero, and the first and last names cannot be empty. If you try to create a player with invalid data, the program raises an error. Additionally, the Player class has a method to generate a nickname for the player, which is a short version of their name, like "P.Perez" for "Pedro Perez." The class also includes static methods (methods that belong to the class, not to individual players) to calculate things like the average speed of all players.

**Example Code:** Setting a Nickname and Calculating Average Speed

`The average_speed,` method calculates the average speed of all players in the list. In this case, the average of 10 and 20 is 15.

```python
# Create players
player1 = Player("Pedro", "Perez", 10)
player2 = Player("Juan", "Smith", 20)

# Set nicknames
player1.set_nickname()
print(player1.nickname)  # Output: P.Perez

# Calculate average speed
average_speed = Player.average_speed()
print(average_speed)  # Output: 15 (since (10 + 20) / 2 = 15)

```

- **Do Use Unit Tests:**
Unit tests are small programs that automatically check if different parts of the code are working as expected. In this project, the file test_Player.py contains tests written using Python unittest framework. These tests steps:

- If the Player class correctly creates players.
- If nicknames are generated properly.
- If invalid inputs like a speed of zero or empty names cause errors.
- If the average speed and other calculations work correctly.
- By running these tests, we can be confident that the code works correctly.

**Example Code:** A Test for Player Creation
This test creates a player and checks if their first name, last name, speed, and ID are set correctly.
If anything is incorrect, the test will fail, and fix the problem quickly.

```python
class TestPlayer(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_init(self):
        player = Player("Pedro", "Perez", 10)
        self.assertEqual(player.fname, "Pedro")
        self.assertEqual(player.lname, "Perez")
        self.assertEqual(player.speed, 10)
        self.assertEqual(player.id, 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```
- **How Are Tests Organized:**
The tests are organized in a class called TestPlayer, which runs one test at a time. Before each test, the setUp() method clears the list of players and resets the player count to ensure each test starts with a clean slate. For example:
**Example Code:** Testing Invalid Input.

These tests check that `invalid inputs` like empty `names` or a `speed` of `zero` cause errors. If the Player class doesnâ€™t raise an error for these cases, the test will fail.

```python
def test_invalid_input(self):
    with self.assertRaises(AssertionError):
        Player("", "Perez", 10)  # First name is empty
    with self.assertRaises(AssertionError):
        Player("Pedro", "", 10)  # Last name is empty
    with self.assertRaises(AssertionError):
        Player("Pedro", "Perez", 0)  # Speed is zero
```


- **Automating Testing with Azure Pipelines:**
The project uses Azure Pipelines, a tool that automatically runs tests whenever you push changes to the code repository.

- Run the unit tests and check if all of them pass.
- This configuration runs the tests in the unit_tests folder every time code is pushed to the master branch.
- If a test fails, the pipeline stops, and the developer is notified to fix the issue.

## 8 Branch Policies and Protection repositories with GitHub

- In `GitHub`, branch protection rules can be configured to enforce `specific requirements on branches`. For example, you can require pull request reviews before merging, `enforce status checks`, and restrict who can push to the branch.

- On `GitHub`, navigate to the main page of the `repository`
-To the `right` of the branch protection rule you want to edit, `click Edit`.
-Make your desired changes to the `branch protection` rule.
-`Click` Save changes.

- See the [Branch Policies with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule), file for `details`.



```
1. Branch Structure:

## 9 Troubleshooting Guide 

- ** any issues, try the following steps**

- **1.  all required dependencies are installed by running:** Make sure you have installed all the required packages that the project needs.

pip install -r requirements.txt


- **2. Run Unit Tests to Find Errors:**  To run the tests, use this command:
python -m unittest discover -s unit_tests

If a test fails, it means there is a problem in the code. The error message will tell you what went wrong and in which part of the code. Fix the issue and run the tests again to make sure everything works.


- **3. Check CI Pipeline Logs for Errors:** If you are using a CI/CD pipeline, like GitHub  and it fails, you need to check the pipeline logs to understand the problem




![Description of the image](images/update-pipeline-failed.png)
<br>

- **4. Restore the README.md File from an Older Commit:** If the README.md file was accidentally changed or deleted, you can restore it to an earlier version. Use this command to bring back the version from commit: 
git checkout f373b14 -- README.md

<br>

- **5. fix or changes the branchs:**

Sometimes, you might need to switch to a different branch or fix issues in the current branch. Follow these steps:
**To see which branch you are on:**  git branch
**To switch to a different branch:** git checkout name
**To create a new branch:** git checkout -b new-branch-name
for issues :
```
git status
git push origin master --force
```
